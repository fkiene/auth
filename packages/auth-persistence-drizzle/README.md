# @yielded/auth-persistence-drizzle

Drizzle bindings, table mappings, and migration helpers for Yielded Auth. This
package uses the shared storage contracts and SQL kernels in
`@yielded/auth-persistence`.

Import mapping helpers from the root and a driver from its explicit module, such
as `/Postgres` or `/SqliteBun`. Install `drizzle-orm` and the corresponding Effect
SQL driver. Each driver exposes `AuthPersistence` and the lower-level factories.

PostgreSQL consumers that only need database acquisition, session ports, or
Connected OAuth custody can use `/PostgresDatabase`, `/PostgresSessions`, or
`/PostgresOAuthConnected`. These paths share `/Postgres`'s database service and
native adapters without loading unrelated auth factories.

Drizzle RC4 does not yet support the current stable Effect APIs required by Yielded
Auth. Bun consumers need the temporary
[@yielded/drizzle-effect-v4-patch](../drizzle-effect-v4-patch/README.md) until they
upgrade to a compatible upstream Drizzle release.

Applications own subjects, policy, claims, delivery, and database connections.
Drizzle Kit generates migrations from managed or application-declared tables.
Provide `AuthPersistence.migrationsLayer({ migrationsFolder })` explicitly to
apply those files before starting auth.

See the [adapter guide](../../docs/src/content/docs/reference/adapters.md) for transaction ownership,
runtime constraints, and runnable examples.
